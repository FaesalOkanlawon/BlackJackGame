# BlackJackGame
Developed a blackjack game with both GUI and console-based interfaces, utilizing Java object-oriented programming principles inheritance and polymorphism for clean code structure. Implemented the Blackjack gameplay with card dealing, hand evaluation, and winner determination based on hand values. It is still a work in progress as I'm finishing up on the message to be displayed on the GUI interface in cases where the player busts and loses or wins and gets additional cash.
